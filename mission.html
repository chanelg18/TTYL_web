<h4> What's wrong with texting while driving? 
<p>Have you ever been in a car where someone is texting and drving? It's annoying right? Especially when
you're in the passenger seat and have to be the eyes for the driver. Wellr takes their eyes off the road for just five seconds when driving at 55 mph
 is enough time to cover the length of a football field. According to 
 'Textinganddrivingsafety.com,' 48% of teens has seen their parents on their phones while driving. 
 Children look to their parents as a role model, and someone who can always protect them. 
 When a parent is distracted when driving it hurts their child more ways than they think.
 An email, call, social media, or text isn't worth your life or others around you.
Our mission is to minimize the 1.6 million crashes that happen every year, that are due to distracted driving.
Making an app like this is so important to not only us but the world around us.

 <h4> What does TTYL do? </h4>
 <p> TTYL is a hands free mobile app that promotes safe driving for all drivers.
 Before you enter your vehicle, you open the app and press the 'Start Driving.&quot; 
 If sombody texts you when the 'Start Driving' timer is stil on and you're still in the app
it will voice who texted you and their message, the app will also send them an automatic 
text which the user can personalize. 

<h4> Why a Pistachio? </h4> 
 A question that we're asked frequently is "Why is your mascot a pistschio?"
When we were laying the foundations to the app we wanted something unique and something that would standout. 
So we chose the infamous pistachio. If you've eaten a pistachio before you would know that the shell is hard and durable, like it's guarding the nut.
In our case the app is the shell, protecting our users from the dangers of distracted driving. The nut is of course the user, who's only job is to be safe and comfortable.
We also wanted to give back, and give people an incentive for beig responsible. 
So sticking with the pistachio theme, we partenered up with a charity called ---- to give back to the world 
 Every car ride you take builds a part of tree, when all parts of the tree are complete, our partner ---- then builds a tree somewhere around the world.
 Our app isnt just about saving lives, but also saving the world
